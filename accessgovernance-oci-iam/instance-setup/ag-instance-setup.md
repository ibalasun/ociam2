### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
 * Create AG Service Instance
 * Access the AG console url
 * Create Users in OCI IAM
 * Create AG Policies

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A valid Oracle OCI tenancy, with OCI administrator privileges. 
- Choose a region where Access Governance is available. 


## Task 1: Create AG Service instance 

Login to the OCI console using the Identity domain: ag-domain, if not currently not logged in to the Identity domain. 

1. In the OCI console, click the Navigation Menu icon in the top left corner to display the *Navigation menu.* Click *Identity and Security* in the *Navigation menu*.

    First Name: Pamela
    Last Name: Green
    Username: pamela.green
    Email: Specify unique email-id to which you will be receiving activation mail for password reset for the user. 
    ```
    ![Create User](images/user-create-pamela.png)

    Click *Create*

    ```
    First Name: Harlan
    Last Name: Bullard
    Username: harlan.bullard
    Email: Specify unique email-id to which you will be receiving activation mail for password reset for the user. 
    ```
    ![Create User](images/user-create-harlan.png)

    Email: Specify unique email-id to which you will be receiving activation mail for password reset for the user. 
    ```
    ![Create User](images/user-create-mark.png)

    Click *Create*

5. Sign out from the cloud console.

6. For each user created, an activation mail will be sent to the email-id provided in the *Task 3: Step 4* . Reset the password for the 3 users using the *Activation mail* recieved for each of them. 
    Reset password to the below mentioned password:

    **Password:**
     ```
    <copy>Oracl@123456</copy>
    ```
7. Login to the OCI console Identity Domain: ag-domain as the Identity Domain Administrator. 

    * In the OCI console, navigate to Identity -> Domains ->  ag-domain -> Oracle Cloud Services -> AG-service-instance -> Application Role. 

    * Notice the *AG Administrator* Role and *AG Campaign Administrator* Role listed. Click on the Downward arrow on the right corner for each of them. 

    ![OIG Identity Roles and Access Policies](images/user-approle.png)

    * Click on *Assigned Users -> Manage*. Select *Pamela Green* in *Available Users.* Click on *Assign*

    ![OIG Identity Roles and Access Policies](images/user-approle-list.png)
